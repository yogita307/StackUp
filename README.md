# Sentiment Analysis Project Submission

This project presents a comprehensive sentiment analysis solution applied to a movie_reviews dataset using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to build a robust sentiment analysis model capable of discerning between positive and negative sentiments in movie reviews. The project utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library, emphasizing simplicity and effectiveness in NLP.

# Key Components
# Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:

Acquired the movie_reviews dataset from NLTK, ensuring a balanced distribution of positive and negative reviews.
Utilized tokenization and word frequency distribution to preprocess the data, extracting relevant features for sentiment analysis.
# Sentiment Analysis Implementation:

Implemented sentiment analysis using NLTK's Naive Bayes classifier.
Conducted model training on a carefully selected subset of the dataset and evaluated its accuracy on a separate test set.

# Results Visualization:

Employed a confusion matrix for visualizing the model's performance, providing insights into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Calculated and presented the overall accuracy of the sentiment analysis model.
